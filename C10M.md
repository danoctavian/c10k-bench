it seems like it's worth it for systems in which you use UDP/have small messages
so going through the kernel is actually a significant overhead.

It may not be worth it for something like HTTP because TCP is a much more complex protocol.
With HTTP layered on top it gets even more complex so the bottleneck probably stops being
syscalls so it's less worth it.
